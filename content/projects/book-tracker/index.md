description: "This study explores practical solutions for urban challenges arising from long journeys and uncontrolled city growth. Inspired by the 15 Minute City idea, we focus on making essential services accessible within a 15-minute walk (or bike ride) in Padua. Using a network-based approach, we analyze the current state of the city and propose ways to expand the coverage of services within this timeframe. Our goal is to create a more convenient and sustainable urban living experience, addressing issues like traffic, air quality and time waste."
